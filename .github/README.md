Built on Cosmos SDK, Teritori aims to enhance Web3 individuals, communities & builders experience through an all-in-one hub of dApps.


We believe Web3 tribesâ€™ best interest is in sharing knowledge & toolings to build more, faster. We build tools we want to use ourselves. We also believe writing the beginning of the story will motivate you writing the next pages. 


Below are a few challenges we're trying to address with the first dApps to be released on Teritori:

- Offering decentralized & user-friendly alternatives of the tools & applications we use on a daily basis.
- Allowing you to affirm your Web3 identity & protect your reputation.
- Offering all the basic tools for a DAO to operate and develop itself.
- Connecting communities from IBC blockchains as well as other networks to provide a seamless multi chain experience.
